(A copy counts as playing the exact same card including its [Attack], Recruit, special abilities, and Hero Class symbol.)\nYou can only Coordinate one card to each player on their turn. However, multiple players can each Coordinate one card to the player whose turn it is, in order to give that player a huge advantage.\n* If you are playing a solo game, once per turn, you may discard a card with Coordinate to draw a card.\n* Coordinate is printed on cards in red text to make it easier to notice during other players' turns.\n* When you offer to Coordinate a card to another player, that player can decline. If so, you don't discard that card and that player doesn't play a copy of it.\n* If you are playing with the Final Showdown, you can't Coordinate during that Showdown."

The first play wouldn't get to use the \"[Instinct]: Draw a card\" ability, since you haven't played an [Instinct] card earlier in the turn.

So you would end up getting 4 [Attack] and drawing one card.\n* If you had played a different [Instinct] card before doubling the Cheering Crowds card, then you could would get to use the \"[Instinct]: Draw a card\" ability both times, getting 4 [Attack] and drawing two cards.\nExample 3: Say your first play is using Cheering Crowds to play a [Tech] card twice. Then, you play another card that says \"[Tech]: You get +1 [Attack] for each other [Tech] Hero you played this turn.\" That ability would count both plays of your Cheering Crowds card, giving you +2 [Attack] total.\n* When playing out a big turn, some people like to put the Bystander they're returning temporarily on the Cheering Crowds card to remind themselves they've played it twice.\n* If you use Cheering Crowds to play a Versatile card twice, you could get Recruit with one play and get [Attack] with the other play, or choose the same for both."

If you played two [Tech] Heroes, it costs 4 less. If you played three or more [Tech] Heroes, it costs 6 less.\n* Playing a fourth [Tech] card wouldn't reduce this cost any further since there are only three [Tech] icons listed in this particular Microscopic Size- Changing ability.\n* The second twist is that Microscopic Size- Changing can actually reduce a card's Recruit cost to zero or even a negative number! When you recruit a Microscopic Size-Changing Hero with a negative cost, you actually gain that many Recruit points!\n* Some Villains also have Microscopic Size- Changing. It works the same way, letting you fight that Villain for 2 [Attack] less for each card of the correct color you played this turn, counting up to the number of icons shown in the Microscopic Size-Changing ability.\n* Likewise, if you fight a Villain with Microscopic Size-Changing and reduce its [Attack] value to a negative number, you actually gain that many [Attack] points when you fight it. You don't even need to have any [Attack] points before you fight them.\n* For example, say you play five [Covert] Heroes, then fight a Villain with 3 [Attack] and \"Microscopic Size-Changing [Covert] [Covert] [Covert] [Covert].\" The Villain's [Attack] decreases to -5, and you actually gain 5 [Attack] when you fight them!
